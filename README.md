password at each visit.

When you set up SSH, you'll generate an SSH key and add it to the ssh-agent and
then add the key to your GitHub account. Adding the SSH key to the ssh-agent
ensures that your SSH key has an extra layer of security through the use of a
passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases."

To use your SSH key with a repository owned by an organization that uses SAML
single sign-on, you'll need to authorize it first. For more information, see
"Authorizing an SSH key for use with SAML single sign-on."
